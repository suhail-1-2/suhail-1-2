## Projects
### 1. [gender detection](https://github.com/suhail-1-2/gender-detection-)
   - **Description:** .This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify gender based on images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of males and       females, with key steps including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The notebook also demonstrates the use of various TensorFlow utilities for handling image datasets.
   - Library Imports: TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy are imported for data processing, model building, and visualization.
      Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a specified directory, with training and testing images classified into two classes (male and female).
      Model Building: The notebook likely includes steps to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify gender based on images.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, scikit_learn

### 2. [ Churn Analysis Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ](https://github.com/suhail-1-2/churn-data-analysis)
   - **Description:** This project addresses the issue of customer churn in the telecommunications industry.
         By analyzing customer data, the project aims to predict which customers are likely
         to churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them. The dataset
         used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes various customer attributes..
   - Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to maintain their customer base and
         maximize revenue. By accurately predicting churn, companies can identify at-risk customers
         and implement retention strategies. This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)            
         to predict churn based on customer data, providing valuable insights into customer behavior.

   - **Technologies Used:**    pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras

### 3. [Covid data analysis ](https://github.com/suhail-1-2/python-projects-/blob/main/covid%20data%20analysis.ipynb)
   - **Description:** This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using a dataset that includes various
     statistics about COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and regions. The objective is to extract
     meaningful insights from the data to understand the spread and impact of the virus.
     Problem Solved:
     The project addresses the need for detailed analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data to help stakeholders make informed decisions. By analyzing the dataset, we can identify patterns and trends, understand      regional impacts, and assess the effectiveness of interventions. This information is crucial for public health planning, resource allocation, and policy-making..
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
### 4. [CIFAR-10 Image Classification ](https://github.com/suhail-1-2/CIFAR-10-Image-Classification/tree/main)
   - **Description:**  The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and computer vision research. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate both ANN and CNN models to classify these images accurately.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ANN, CNN
